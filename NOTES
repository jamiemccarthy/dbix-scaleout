DBIx::ScaleOut is kind of a holding class.  It exists mainly so that 'use DBIx::ScaleOut' pulls in the right dependencies and as a place to put db().


db() - function, not method. @EXPORTed by DBIx::ScaleOut so there's really no way for a hypothetical subclass of DBIx::ScaleOut to override it. has to work for all projects, all (::Base) classes, all options

	calls startup() if !$Global, and does rudimentary checking of its arguments

	based on its arguments and on , returns a class instance which is ::Base or a subclass


startup() - has to work when called by db()

	again, since this is EXPORTed I don't really know a way to have a subclass override.  still, allowing for that possibility, it hardcodes its $class as DBIx::ScaleOut and everything it does is a method, so that may be possible eventually.

	$projinst ||= 'main'

	"stage 0": require's DBIx::ScaleOut::Access::$projinst

	loads constants for the projinst, by connecting to the dbinst of the same name as the projinst

	loads vars for the projinst, by connecting to the dbinst of the same name as the projinst, or the memcached it specifies

	reads dxso_iinstset table, processes it, and stores it in $Global->{projinst}{$projinst}{iinstset}

	does a reroll() to start things off

	when complete, everything is set up -- db() will return a valid DBIx::ScaleOut::Base (from $Global cache, creating and initializing it if necessary)



projinst is basically a global, stored in $Global->{default_projinst}.  We specifically do not want to pass it in to any methods except as an option to db() which sends it as an option to startup().  I'm pretty sure no ::Base methods should get passed a projinst except new() (when called by db(), typically).

A dbset has to be specific to a projinst, both because different projects can have dbinsts with the same names, and because even if dbinsts did use the same names to refer to same db's, each project would need separate dbh's to access those DBs to prevent shared handles leading to subtle bugs or security problems. So we store a dbset in $Global->{projinst}{$projinst}{dbset}.



`perl Build.PL` leaves passwords in _build/notes, so we must chmod 600 it somehow

creation of dbinst_tuples is broken and silly, leave it as hashref-of-hashrefs instead of (brokenly) transforming to array-of-hashrefs; this makes ACTION_install simpler too
